# Trash-classification-robotic-arm
By using the robotic arm, create a simple model for classifying trash.

## Introduction

This primary project is a simle application in the responding to the call of saving environment from the trashs specially designed to work instead of human resource. Our robut is planned to put at the place where the garbage could be dealed with properly. By recycling the trash, we are able to protect the world instead of burrying them all.

Our core techniques consist of **Object Detection**, **Image Recognition** and **Grabbing Algorithm** .
